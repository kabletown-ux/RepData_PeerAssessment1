## Libraries
```{r}
library( ggplot2 )
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
rawData <- read.csv( "activity.csv" )
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
sumSteps <- aggregate( steps ~ date, data = rawData, FUN = sum )
## TODO: fix date label crowding!
qplot( date, data = sumSteps, weight = steps, geom = "histogram" )

mean( sumSteps$steps )
median( sumSteps$steps )
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
avgStepsByInterval <- aggregate( steps ~ interval, data = rawData, FUN = mean )
ggplot( data = avgStepsByInterval, aes( x = interval, y = steps ) ) + geom_line() + xlab( "5 Minute Intervals" ) + ylab( "Average Steps Taken" )

## TODO: reformat intervals as times?
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
